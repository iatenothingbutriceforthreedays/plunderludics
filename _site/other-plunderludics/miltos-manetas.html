<h1>Miltos Manetas&#39; Art After Videogames</h1>

<div>
  

  this guy aparently was the first person to make machinima, but also pretty interested in the images generated by videogames as painting. there's an interesting manifesto in his website: "An artist after Videogames should not create anything himself but only extract the hidden notions of the game."
