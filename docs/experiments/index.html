both receiving input, and blending in <a href=/tools/touchdesigner.html style="">TouchDesigner</a>.
also tried blending via checkerboard matte.
also tried blending using a third n64 instance running killer instinct as the matte.

2022-10-28: we also tried making the matte be a smaller portion of the screen, or a single color, black, resulting in a scenario where you could play starfox inside a chain chomp. by using black as a matte we also got the death bowser sweep animation from mario 64 to become a plundered transition between games.

  tapestry 1-3: experiments with four games and manually modifying the blend factor.
    1. two modes of interaction: playing the games and choosing what game was being focused on.
    2. using vcv rack to modulate the fading over time
    3. using vcv rack to control and modulate the games with similar oscillations
  games: gex, mario 64, spiderman, ocarina of time


  tapestry 4: fully fledged tapestry of 16 games backed by invisible character that receives same input as rest
